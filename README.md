# Express.js: Note Taker Application

 ## Description
  For this task we were instructed to build an application called Note Taker where users are able to write and save notes.  This project uses an Express.js backen to save and retrieve information from a JSON file.  This application also uses the UUID NPM package to give the notes stored in the JSON file a unique ID.
